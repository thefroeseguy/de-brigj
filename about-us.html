        <article>
            <h2>Mission:</h2>
            <p>De Brigj informs, entertains, and ministers to the Low German community through its programming. Listeners can stay current on news from Mennonite communities locally and abroad, traffic, weather, community events, and public service announcements. Listeners are also offered entertainment and companionship through music, humour, and ministry segments. De Brigj strives to uphold its mandate of integration and inclusion through information and education.</p>

            <h2>Programs:</h2>
            <h4>News &amp; Information:</h4>
            <p>Listeners receive updates on news, funeral announcements, and other information from Mennonite communities both local and abroad. Traffic, weather, school announcements and bus cancellations are aired regularly, and many community members advertise job openings, houses for rent, and items for sale through purchased advertising time. <em>Waut Passiet</em> is produced locally and one of our more popular general interest programs.</p>

            <h4>Christian Ministry:</h4>
            <p>Gospel music, devotions, and teachings make up a significant part of our programming. We feature well-known Mennonite talent as well as respected local and syndicated preachers and teachers. According to surveys, one of our most listened-to segments is the daily morning and evening Scripture reading.</p>

            <h4>Family &amp; Life Programming:</h4>
            <p>Individuals, parents, and families receive information and support from a Christian perspective on issues such as raising a family, depression, abuse, etc. Popular segments include Frues met Hopnung which is translated from Marli Spieker’s Women of Hope, Tues em Heim with Maria Dyck, and Encuentro with Ernesto Pinto.</p>

            <h4>Youth Ministry:</h4>
            <p>The youth can tune in at 6:30pm every day to hear relative programming geared towards their age group! Again, locally produced programming includes Youth Matters produced in-house by Dwayne Froese. Ekj Ran, which is produced by Eduard Giesbrecht in Bolivia, is also featured.</p>

            <h4>Children's Programming:</h4>
            <p>Children can tune in every day at 5:15 pm for special children’s programming. Plautdietsche Kjinjastund is locally produced by MCS staff and volunteers, and Check It In – Check It Out is produced by Julie Berry and sponsored by the Aylmer Library. Other programming includes Keys for Kids,which airs daily.</p>

            <h4>Song Dedications &amp; Music by Request</h4>
            <p>Birthday and anniversary dedications can be requested every day, and listeners can also call in to request and dedicate any song for any reason during a very popular all-request hour each Wednesday evening.</p>

            <h4>Event Announcements:</h4>
            <p>Our churches often advertise fundraisers, charitable events, and programs. Community partners such as the Southwestern Public Health Unit, Aylmer Police, School Boards, and the library also use our station to provide the Low German community with a variety of information.</p>

        <h1 class="welcome-title text-center" id="history">History of Radio CHPD</h1>
        <p>In 2000, among a group of concerned people, Paul Baldwin, the deputy mayor of Aylmer at the time and Abe Harms, the Executive Director of Mennonite Community Services (MCS) put for the idea of starting a Low German radio station. They surmised that this could be an effective way to reach into people’s homes and communicate with the LG population and give advice as to how to deal with problems they might be facing.  In a culture prone to keep personal problems to themselves, listening to resources on the radio and in the privacy of their home seemed an appropriate strategy.  Besides being useful as a means of communicating mundane information such as weather conditions and school closings, it could also address more complex matters such as health information, relationship and child-rearing issues and other personal matters.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/first-on-air-aug-12-2003.JPG" alt="First On-air Test">
            <figcaption>Radio Manager Henry Rempel speaking over the air waves for the very first time on August 12th, 2003.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>The start of the radio station took longer than expected, but by May 2002, AAIMCC (now MCS) had a hearing with the Canadian Radio and Telecommunication Commission (CRTC) to decide if the new radio station would be allowed to go on air. This new communication medium sparked interest in the larger community with articles written in newspapers—the London Free Press, the Aylmer Express and the St. Thomas Times-Journal—of this initiative.  February 2003, MCS was granted the license to broadcast. Henry Rempel began work as the Radio Manager/Broadcaster on May 1, 2003, and the radio station got its name, De Brigj.  The call letters CHPD were chosen to say <em>Canada Hieet PlautDietsch</em> (Canada Hears Low German). On August 20, 2003 the radio went on air for the first time. Even though MCC Ontario did not want to expand its work in Aylmer, the organization, and in particular Rick Cober Bauman, Aylmer’s supervisor, very generously walked with AAIMCC in its expansion and on the road to local ownership.</p>
        <p>The next goal of the CHPD radio station was to focus on programming and listening to the community.  A radio advisory committee with ears in the community was set up for a time to make sure content had good reception.</p>
        <figure class="right">
            <img src="img/maria-2004.JPG" alt="Maria Dyck">

        </figure>
        <p>With the goal to provide “wholesome, informative, educational programming” in Low German, this radio station was unique to Elgin County and the only Low German radio station in all of Canada. It had the potential of becoming a connecting agent and would serve as a bridge to the community. Therefore, its name <em>De Brigj</em>, Low German for "The Bridge," seemed most fitting.  The radio was never meant to be a “crutch” to help people get away without learning English.  The motto from the beginning was “Integration and inclusion through information and education.” For newcomers and those who didn’t know English, this allowed them to feel at home. It was “a window to their new world”.  Furthermore, since word of mouth is so powerful, it became an ideal way to communicate events in the community. Its focus was not on evangelism-based programs, but every part of the station served to encourage and uplift those listening. Soon people rearranged their schedules so they could go home between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. and listen to the Low German radio.  Others bought radios to listen specifically to this station. Family members even requested recordings of programs to send to extended family members in their home countries. The work of <em>De Brigj</em> was clearly valued.</p>

            <figcaption>The radio tower being installed in August of 2003.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>By 2005, the radio had outgrown its initial limitations.  Although originally broadcasting on 107.7, a CRTC decision allowed the switch to 105.9, and increasing its broadcasting capability from 50 watts to 250 watts.  This meant that it could reach more people. The radio project took on an exciting mission of its own.  Its programs included the broadcasting of events such as the annual charity auction, ‘<em>Utroop</em>’ held in June each year and designed to unite the community around cultural food, fun and rally around raising funds for AAIMCC and MCC.
        <figure class="right">
            <img src="img/jake-lena.JPG" alt="Jake and Lena Wall">
            <figcaption>Jake &amp; Lena Wall were hired in 2007 to develop the "Safe Haven" program.</figcaption>
        </figure></p>
        
        <p>In 2007, an exciting opportunity was afforded AAIMCC as it received funding from the Attorney General’s Office of Ontario to develop a radio broadcast in Low German on the issues of violence and crime. Since most Low German Mennonites do not reach out for community help when facing domestic violence, this became an important resource. Complete with classes on healthy relationships, counselling, and phone services for support, this program, known as <em>Safe Haven</em>, was facilitated by Jake and Lena Wall.</p>
        <p>The radio served as a communication venue for accessing supportive services in the community and for breaking down social barriers. People who would be ordinarily closed to discussions of domestic violence and who would suffer in silence now had access to resources and support.   Much more than a source of entertainment and communication, the radio soon became an important ministry, reminding newcomers that hope and help were available to them.</p>
